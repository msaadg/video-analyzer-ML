# ðŸŽ¥ Real-Time Video Feed Analyzer with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project is a real-time video feed analyzer powered by a **Random Forest Classifier**. The backend is built with **Python** to handle video analysis, while the frontend uses **Next.js**, **Typescript**, and **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive user interface. The system processes video feeds and logs analysis results in real time using WebSocket for seamless communication between the frontend and backend.

## Key Features:
- **Real-Time Video Analysis**: Utilizes a **Random Forest Classifier** to analyze video feeds in real time.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time logging and communication between frontend and backend.
- **Responsive Frontend**: Built with **Next.js**, **Typescript**, and **Tailwind CSS** for a smooth, user-friendly experience.
- **Python Backend**: Processes video feeds and runs the machine learning model.

## Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python, Random Forest Classifier
- **Communication**: WebSocket for real-time updates
